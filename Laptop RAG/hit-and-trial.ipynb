You can keep your eyes where the action is—the FHD graphics rendering in more than 2 million pixels at refresh rates 60 Hz, with brightness levels at 300 nits. And you’ll get an amazingly immersive experience from the tear-free video of optional NVIDIA® G-SYNC™ technology.  \\n### Full-throttle power beneath the hood  \\nThe Y730 has a lot of muscle underneath its thin exterior. Pooling thousands of hours of experience and expertise in battery, I/O placement, thermals, motherboard design, and more, we’ve packed it with high-performance gaming hardware—including up to 16 GB overclocked Corsair® Memory and PCIe NVMe SSD storage.  \\n### All of the power, none of the heat  \\nDespite its souped-up performance, the Y730 will stay cool and quiet, so you can enjoy your games. It’s been remastered with a dual-channel thermal system, with the following benefits: individual CPU and GPU cooling, for cooler system temperatures; four thermal vents, for improved airflow; and 66 individual fan blades per channel, to reduce system noise.  \\n### Full connectivity  \\nThe Y730 features a convenient array of ports and connectors; plug in an external device or accessory, or simply charge or secure your laptop with the following, as shown above:  \\n1. Mini DP 1.4 port\\n2. HDMI 2.0 port\\n3. 2 x USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports\\\\*\\n4. RJ-45 port\\n5. AC adaptor port\\n6.

Powered by NVIDIA® VRWorks technology, a new level of presence is achieved by bringing physically realistic visuals, sound, touch interactions, and simulated environments to virtual reality. And with NVIDIA® GeForce® 10-series graphics, the Alienware 17 goes beyond what’s expected.  \\n### HIGHER PERFORMANCE INSIDE OUT  \\nBuilt with premium materials and up to 7th Gen Intel® Core™ i7 and i7k-Series processors, the Alienware 17 is the ultimate evolution in high-performance gaming technology. Utilizing magnesium alloy for rigidity, copper for better performance, anodized aluminum for extra protection and steel for tactile comfort, it features a high-quality design for high-performance gaming. And with support for up to NVIDIA® GeForce GTX 1080Ti or AMD Radeon RX 470 graphics, overclocked CPUs at 4.4GHz, and high-speed DDR4 system memory capable of up to 2667 MHz, you can experience gaming on a whole new level.  \\n### A REVOLUTIONARY WAY TO USE YOUR PC  \\nTobii Aware software enables new gameplay functions for a completely unique user experience. Let your eyes be the controller and lose yourself in the game.  \\n### NOTHING BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR GAMING  \\nWitness the difference an expansive 17-inch LCD screen can make with supported FHD, QHD 120Hz and UHD resolution options – all with anti-glare finish. The 17\" QHD 120Hz display is designed to deliver the smoothest gaming experience with a 4-millisecond response time, wide viewing angles and 400 nits of brightness. The UHD panel offers a 100% color gamut for an incredible, saturated range of reds, greens and blues (compared to the 72% offered by QHD and FHD). NVIDIA® G-Sync technology, available on select models, delivers the smoothest, fastest experience ever thanks to synchronized display refresh rates to the GPU in your GeForce® GTX-powered PC, eliminating screen tearing and minimizing display stutter and input lag.  \\n### A KEYBOARD LIKE NO OTHER  \\nWith an upgraded Alienware TactX keyboard, n-key rollover is now supported, enabling over 108-key commands for maximum actions per minute. It’s the only keyboard on a laptop with 2.2mm of key travel allowing for rapid response for any keystroke. Reinforced with a steel back plate for rigidity and uniform feedback with a guarantee to stay functional for up to 10 million keystrokes. Create a more personalized look for your machine with new and improved AlienFX. Designed with optimized RGB-LED enabled AlienFX lighting and now supported on over 130 games, with the option to create and download unique themes.  \\n### DESIGNED TO KEEP COOL.  \\nHigher maximum thermal design power (TDP) support means that your system can handle a higher total wattage for internal components, enabling a higher level of performance. With the entire ventilation system upgraded, your system can stay cool even under extreme graphics pressure.  \\n### HEAR EVERY BATTLE CRY..  \\nDue to the upgraded design, a larger and more effective speaker box has been installed, improving audio output for a clearer and more dramatic gaming experience.  \\n### CLEAR THE DESKTOP & THE BOARD.  \\nAvoid excess cables and embrace the “desktop mode” design, where most of your critical connections and ports are in the back and out of the way.  \\n### EXPERIENCE THE FULL SPECTRUM  \\nAlienFX uses 20 different colors to create over 80 quadrillion unique themes to give your machine a more personalized look. Supported on over 130 titles, lighting zones can be customized to react to things like in game actions, powering on and off, and notifications by pulsing, morphing or simply holding a solid color. Once you’ve finished your theme, you can save and upload it to the Alienware Arena community site where you can share your custom creation with others and download any you find. And for times when you want a little less visual stimulation, AlienFX allows you to “go dark” by disabling all lighting effects until you’re ready to turn them back on.  \\n### PORTS AND SLOTS  \\n1.

Style. Innovation. These are the qualities that define the elegant new ZenBook 15. Everything in this take-anywhere masterpiece — it’s the world’s smallest 15-inch laptops\\\\* — is designed to give you the freedom to discover your creative power, including its breathtaking frameless NanoEdge display. You’ll appreciate not only the tremendous power within and the thoughtful attention to detail — such as the exclusive ErgoLift hinge and Numeric keypad — but also the timeless beauty of the design, with its sensational Royal Blue finish enhanced by the new Rose Gold trim panel. ZenBook 15 is waiting: are you ready to unleash your creative power?  \\n### Unbounded beauty  \\nDesigned to give you the most screen area in the least physical space, the new frameless four-sided NanoEdge design of ZenBook 15 is simply breathtaking: it makes any visuals more immersive, with less distraction for your eyes. The ultraslim bezels1 are just 3mm thin at the sides, 4.5mm at the bottom and a mere 6.4mm at the top to accommodate the camera. The effect is truly stunning — it’s like an infinity pool for your eyes! And with this ultra-compact display, ZenBook 15 is one of the smallest 15-inch laptops around — as small as many 14-inch models.  \\n### Spectacular visuals  \\nCreativity demands a great screen, so ZenBook 15 has a high-resolution FHD display that\\'s beautifully crisp and clear, with wide viewing angles and vivid, accurate colors that give you an ultra-realistic viewing experience for movies, photos and games. It also features exclusive ASUS technologies — including ASUS Splendid and ASUS Tru2Life Video — that fine-tune display parameters to ensure optimum eye comfort and color performance, for any kind of content.  \\n### Ultraportable, redefined  \\nZenBook 15 heralds a new era of ultraportable design, with an ultracompact, ultralight chassis that makes it our smallest and lightest 15-inch laptop ever — in fact, at around the size of a 14-in laptop and just 3.5 lb, it’s one of the smallest and lightest 15-inch laptops — period!

Choose Moonlight White or Eclipse Gray, which both light up the 6,536 precision-milled perforations in the lid with a programmable AniMe Matrix™ mini-LED display. Or go with Holographic White or Holographic Gray for a subtler prismatic effect. A magnesium-aluminum alloy with honeycomb reinforcements keeps the chassis both strong and light.  \\n### Precision Machining  \\nThe striking dot matrix design on the lid is made with a precision CNC milling process that creates 6,536 perfectly spaced perforations in an incredibly small surface area. The unique pattern is stylish yet subtle, with the diameter of the openings carefully chosen to emit just the right amount of light from the 1,215 mini-LEDs that lie below on the optional AniMe Matrix™ display.  \\n### Light It Up  \\nThe groundbreaking AniMe Matrix™ display shows off your creativity through 1,215 programmable mini-LEDs that illuminate the lid. Display custom designs, unique animations, and live audio visualizations for extra flair. Or stay in the loop with status notifications about battery life, calendar, alarm and more. An all-new virtual pet from the ROG universe can hang out on the AniMe Matrix™, too. This interactive assistant reacts to system usage and battery level—and also stars in its own desktop app!  \\n### Display  \\nChoose the display that fits your needs. For the best of both worlds, the 120Hz QHD panel blends high refresh rates with high resolution and a pro-grade DCI-P3 color gamut. For lightning-fast gaming, the 144Hz Full HD panel mixes even higher refresh with vibrant sRGB color. Both are Pantone® Validated for color accuracy. The two panels also support Adaptive-Sync, synchronizing the display and GPU to eliminate tearing and make gameplay silky smooth. Super-narrow bezels around the display practically fade into the background, keeping you fully engrossed in what’s on-screen.  \\n| More Information Model            | GA401QM-211.ZG14                   |\\n| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |\\n| Series                            | ROG Zephyrus G14 series            |\\n| Type                              | Gaming Laptop                      |\\n| Suitable For                      | Gaming , Video editing , Rendering |\\n| Battery Cell                      | 4-cell Li-ion                      |\\n| Power Supply                      | 180W AC Adapter                    |\\n| Weight                            | 4.7 kg                             |\\n| Processor Brand                   | AMD                                |\\n| Processor Name                    | Ryzen™ 9 5900HS                    |\\n| Graphic Processor                 | RTX 3060                           |\\n| SSD                               | 1TB                                |\\n| RAM                               | 16GB                               |\\n| RAM Type                          | DDR4                               |\\n| Clock Speed                       | 3.1 Ghz Up to 4.5 Ghz              |\\n| RAM Frequency                     | 3200 Mhz                           |\\n| Cache                             | 16 Mb                              |\\n| Dedicated Graphic Memory Type     | GDDR6                              |\\n| Dedicated Graphic Memory Capacity | 6GB                                |\\n| Operating System                  | Window 10                          |\\n| RJ45                              | Yes                                |\\n| USB Port                          | 4 x 3.2 USB                        |\\n| HDMI Port                         | 1 x HDMI                           |\\n| Mic In                            | Yes                                |\\n| Other Ports & Slots               | 1x 3.5mm Combo Audio Jack          |  \\n1x HDMI 2.0b\\n1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C\\n2x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A\\n1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C support DisplayPort / power delivery / G-SYNC\\nTouchscreen | No\\nScreen Size | 14 \"\\nScreen Resolution | 1920x1080\\nScreen Type | FHD 144 Hz\\nSpeakers | 2x 4W speaker with smart AMP technology\\nWireless LAN | Wi-Fi 6(802.11ax)\\nBluetooth | Bluetooth 5.1 (Dual band) 2\\\\*2\\nEthernet | Gigabite\\nKeyboard | Backlit Chiclet Keyboard\\nPointer Device | Touch pad\\nIn the box | Main Unit\\nWarranty document\\nUser manual\\nCharger\\nWarranty Period | 1 year  \\nURL:https://dealayo.com/catalog/product/view/id/28679/s/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-gaming-amd-ryzen-r9-5900hs-1tb-ssd-16gb-ram-14-fhd-144hz-rtx-3060-6gb-windows-10/category/77  \\n-----End of the Product------'),\n",

High-FPS gameplay is richer with a balance of high-resolution detail, a 165Hz refresh rate, and a 3ms response time. See full-spectrum color accuracy thanks to Pantone® validation and 100% DCI-P3, ideal for gamers who also create. A tall 16:10 aspect ratio expands views, making it easy to keep critical commands in view.  \\n### Adaptive-Sync Technology  \\nNothing breaks in-game immersion like stuttering and tearing. GPUs render frames at variable rates, but displays usually refresh at a constant clip, so they frequently get out of sync. With Adaptive-Sync, the refresh rate of the display synchronizes with the GPU’s frame rate to eliminate visual tearing, minimize stuttering, and reduce input lag for gameplay that looks and feels more natural.  \\n### Intelligent Cooling Enables Quiet Power  \\nROG’s Intelligent Cooling philosophy mixes the right features and settings to ensure the best experience for each chassis. For the Zephyrus M16, liquid metal compound cools the CPU. A customized self-cleaning 2.0 thermal module clears dust to improve long-term stability, while Arc Flow fans are designed to generate impressive airflow with reduced turbulence, ensuring powerful-yet-quiet cooling.  \\n### Sink Into Sublime Sound  \\nStreaming, recording, and gaming are streamlined with the Zephyrus M16’s multi-faceted audio system. Boasting Dolby Atmos® technology, twin tweeters and dual force-canceling woofers, acoustics are beautifully balanced, with Hi-Res certification that supports media at the highest fidelity. A customizable 3D Mic array captures audio in a variety of scenarios, while Two-Way AI Noise Cancelation clarifies sound from your feed and incoming feeds as well.\\n![](https://dealayo.com/media/wysiwyg/Gaming_laptop/asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-gu603he/asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-gu603he-desc-4-nepal.JPG)  \\n### Lighter.

You can keep your eyes where the action is—the FHD graphics rendering in more than 2 million pixels at refresh rates 60 Hz, with brightness levels at 300 nits. And you’ll get an amazingly immersive experience from the tear-free video of optional NVIDIA® G-SYNC™ technology.  \\n### Full-throttle power beneath the hood  \\nThe Y730 has a lot of muscle underneath its thin exterior. Pooling thousands of hours of experience and expertise in battery, I/O placement, thermals, motherboard design, and more, we’ve packed it with high-performance gaming hardware—including up to 16 GB overclocked Corsair® Memory and PCIe NVMe SSD storage.  \\n### All of the power, none of the heat  \\nDespite its souped-up performance, the Y730 will stay cool and quiet, so you can enjoy your games. It’s been remastered with a dual-channel thermal system, with the following benefits: individual CPU and GPU cooling, for cooler system temperatures; four thermal vents, for improved airflow; and 66 individual fan blades per channel, to reduce system noise.  \\n### Full connectivity  \\nThe Y730 features a convenient array of ports and connectors; plug in an external device or accessory, or simply charge or secure your laptop with the following, as shown above:  \\n1. Mini DP 1.4 port\\n2. HDMI 2.0 port\\n3. 2 x USB 3.1 Gen 2 ports\\\\*\\n4. RJ-45 port\\n5. AC adaptor port\\n6.

Powered by NVIDIA® VRWorks technology, a new level of presence is achieved by bringing physically realistic visuals, sound, touch interactions, and simulated environments to virtual reality. And with NVIDIA® GeForce® 10-series graphics, the Alienware 17 goes beyond what’s expected.  \\n### HIGHER PERFORMANCE INSIDE OUT  \\nBuilt with premium materials and up to 7th Gen Intel® Core™ i7 and i7k-Series processors, the Alienware 17 is the ultimate evolution in high-performance gaming technology. Utilizing magnesium alloy for rigidity, copper for better performance, anodized aluminum for extra protection and steel for tactile comfort, it features a high-quality design for high-performance gaming. And with support for up to NVIDIA® GeForce GTX 1080Ti or AMD Radeon RX 470 graphics, overclocked CPUs at 4.4GHz, and high-speed DDR4 system memory capable of up to 2667 MHz, you can experience gaming on a whole new level.  \\n### A REVOLUTIONARY WAY TO USE YOUR PC  \\nTobii Aware software enables new gameplay functions for a completely unique user experience. Let your eyes be the controller and lose yourself in the game.  \\n### NOTHING BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR GAMING  \\nWitness the difference an expansive 17-inch LCD screen can make with supported FHD, QHD 120Hz and UHD resolution options – all with anti-glare finish. The 17\" QHD 120Hz display is designed to deliver the smoothest gaming experience with a 4-millisecond response time, wide viewing angles and 400 nits of brightness. The UHD panel offers a 100% color gamut for an incredible, saturated range of reds, greens and blues (compared to the 72% offered by QHD and FHD). NVIDIA® G-Sync technology, available on select models, delivers the smoothest, fastest experience ever thanks to synchronized display refresh rates to the GPU in your GeForce® GTX-powered PC, eliminating screen tearing and minimizing display stutter and input lag.  \\n### A KEYBOARD LIKE NO OTHER  \\nWith an upgraded Alienware TactX keyboard, n-key rollover is now supported, enabling over 108-key commands for maximum actions per minute. It’s the only keyboard on a laptop with 2.2mm of key travel allowing for rapid response for any keystroke. Reinforced with a steel back plate for rigidity and uniform feedback with a guarantee to stay functional for up to 10 million keystrokes. Create a more personalized look for your machine with new and improved AlienFX. Designed with optimized RGB-LED enabled AlienFX lighting and now supported on over 130 games, with the option to create and download unique themes.  \\n### DESIGNED TO KEEP COOL.  \\nHigher maximum thermal design power (TDP) support means that your system can handle a higher total wattage for internal components, enabling a higher level of performance. With the entire ventilation system upgraded, your system can stay cool even under extreme graphics pressure.  \\n### HEAR EVERY BATTLE CRY..  \\nDue to the upgraded design, a larger and more effective speaker box has been installed, improving audio output for a clearer and more dramatic gaming experience.  \\n### CLEAR THE DESKTOP & THE BOARD.  \\nAvoid excess cables and embrace the “desktop mode” design, where most of your critical connections and ports are in the back and out of the way.  \\n### EXPERIENCE THE FULL SPECTRUM  \\nAlienFX uses 20 different colors to create over 80 quadrillion unique themes to give your machine a more personalized look. Supported on over 130 titles, lighting zones can be customized to react to things like in game actions, powering on and off, and notifications by pulsing, morphing or simply holding a solid color. Once you’ve finished your theme, you can save and upload it to the Alienware Arena community site where you can share your custom creation with others and download any you find. And for times when you want a little less visual stimulation, AlienFX allows you to “go dark” by disabling all lighting effects until you’re ready to turn them back on.  \\n### PORTS AND SLOTS  \\n1.

Style. Innovation. These are the qualities that define the elegant new ZenBook 15. Everything in this take-anywhere masterpiece — it’s the world’s smallest 15-inch laptops\\\\* — is designed to give you the freedom to discover your creative power, including its breathtaking frameless NanoEdge display. You’ll appreciate not only the tremendous power within and the thoughtful attention to detail — such as the exclusive ErgoLift hinge and Numeric keypad — but also the timeless beauty of the design, with its sensational Royal Blue finish enhanced by the new Rose Gold trim panel. ZenBook 15 is waiting: are you ready to unleash your creative power?  \\n### Unbounded beauty  \\nDesigned to give you the most screen area in the least physical space, the new frameless four-sided NanoEdge design of ZenBook 15 is simply breathtaking: it makes any visuals more immersive, with less distraction for your eyes. The ultraslim bezels1 are just 3mm thin at the sides, 4.5mm at the bottom and a mere 6.4mm at the top to accommodate the camera. The effect is truly stunning — it’s like an infinity pool for your eyes! And with this ultra-compact display, ZenBook 15 is one of the smallest 15-inch laptops around — as small as many 14-inch models.  \\n### Spectacular visuals  \\nCreativity demands a great screen, so ZenBook 15 has a high-resolution FHD display that\\'s beautifully crisp and clear, with wide viewing angles and vivid, accurate colors that give you an ultra-realistic viewing experience for movies, photos and games. It also features exclusive ASUS technologies — including ASUS Splendid and ASUS Tru2Life Video — that fine-tune display parameters to ensure optimum eye comfort and color performance, for any kind of content.  \\n### Ultraportable, redefined  \\nZenBook 15 heralds a new era of ultraportable design, with an ultracompact, ultralight chassis that makes it our smallest and lightest 15-inch laptop ever — in fact, at around the size of a 14-in laptop and just 3.5 lb, it’s one of the smallest and lightest 15-inch laptops — period!

Choose Moonlight White or Eclipse Gray, which both light up the 6,536 precision-milled perforations in the lid with a programmable AniMe Matrix™ mini-LED display. Or go with Holographic White or Holographic Gray for a subtler prismatic effect. A magnesium-aluminum alloy with honeycomb reinforcements keeps the chassis both strong and light.  \\n### Precision Machining  \\nThe striking dot matrix design on the lid is made with a precision CNC milling process that creates 6,536 perfectly spaced perforations in an incredibly small surface area. The unique pattern is stylish yet subtle, with the diameter of the openings carefully chosen to emit just the right amount of light from the 1,215 mini-LEDs that lie below on the optional AniMe Matrix™ display.  \\n### Light It Up  \\nThe groundbreaking AniMe Matrix™ display shows off your creativity through 1,215 programmable mini-LEDs that illuminate the lid. Display custom designs, unique animations, and live audio visualizations for extra flair. Or stay in the loop with status notifications about battery life, calendar, alarm and more. An all-new virtual pet from the ROG universe can hang out on the AniMe Matrix™, too. This interactive assistant reacts to system usage and battery level—and also stars in its own desktop app!  \\n### Display  \\nChoose the display that fits your needs. For the best of both worlds, the 120Hz QHD panel blends high refresh rates with high resolution and a pro-grade DCI-P3 color gamut. For lightning-fast gaming, the 144Hz Full HD panel mixes even higher refresh with vibrant sRGB color. Both are Pantone® Validated for color accuracy. The two panels also support Adaptive-Sync, synchronizing the display and GPU to eliminate tearing and make gameplay silky smooth. Super-narrow bezels around the display practically fade into the background, keeping you fully engrossed in what’s on-screen.  \\n| More Information Model            | GA401QM-211.ZG14                   |\\n| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |\\n| Series                            | ROG Zephyrus G14 series            |\\n| Type                              | Gaming Laptop                      |\\n| Suitable For                      | Gaming , Video editing , Rendering |\\n| Battery Cell                      | 4-cell Li-ion                      |\\n| Power Supply                      | 180W AC Adapter                    |\\n| Weight                            | 4.7 kg                             |\\n| Processor Brand                   | AMD                                |\\n| Processor Name                    | Ryzen™ 9 5900HS                    |\\n| Graphic Processor                 | RTX 3060                           |\\n| SSD                               | 1TB                                |\\n| RAM                               | 16GB                               |\\n| RAM Type                          | DDR4                               |\\n| Clock Speed                       | 3.1 Ghz Up to 4.5 Ghz              |\\n| RAM Frequency                     | 3200 Mhz                           |\\n| Cache                             | 16 Mb                              |\\n| Dedicated Graphic Memory Type     | GDDR6                              |\\n| Dedicated Graphic Memory Capacity | 6GB                                |\\n| Operating System                  | Window 10                          |\\n| RJ45                              | Yes                                |\\n| USB Port                          | 4 x 3.2 USB                        |\\n| HDMI Port                         | 1 x HDMI                           |\\n| Mic In                            | Yes                                |\\n| Other Ports & Slots               | 1x 3.5mm Combo Audio Jack          |  \\n1x HDMI 2.0b\\n1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C\\n2x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A\\n1x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C support DisplayPort / power delivery / G-SYNC\\nTouchscreen | No\\nScreen Size | 14 \"\\nScreen Resolution | 1920x1080\\nScreen Type | FHD 144 Hz\\nSpeakers | 2x 4W speaker with smart AMP technology\\nWireless LAN | Wi-Fi 6(802.11ax)\\nBluetooth | Bluetooth 5.1 (Dual band) 2\\\\*2\\nEthernet | Gigabite\\nKeyboard | Backlit Chiclet Keyboard\\nPointer Device | Touch pad\\nIn the box | Main Unit\\nWarranty document\\nUser manual\\nCharger\\nWarranty Period | 1 year  \\nURL:https://dealayo.com/catalog/product/view/id/28679/s/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-gaming-amd-ryzen-r9-5900hs-1tb-ssd-16gb-ram-14-fhd-144hz-rtx-3060-6gb-windows-10/category/77  \\n-----End of the Product------'),\n",

High-FPS gameplay is richer with a balance of high-resolution detail, a 165Hz refresh rate, and a 3ms response time. See full-spectrum color accuracy thanks to Pantone® validation and 100% DCI-P3, ideal for gamers who also create. A tall 16:10 aspect ratio expands views, making it easy to keep critical commands in view.  \\n### Adaptive-Sync Technology  \\nNothing breaks in-game immersion like stuttering and tearing. GPUs render frames at variable rates, but displays usually refresh at a constant clip, so they frequently get out of sync. With Adaptive-Sync, the refresh rate of the display synchronizes with the GPU’s frame rate to eliminate visual tearing, minimize stuttering, and reduce input lag for gameplay that looks and feels more natural.  \\n### Intelligent Cooling Enables Quiet Power  \\nROG’s Intelligent Cooling philosophy mixes the right features and settings to ensure the best experience for each chassis. For the Zephyrus M16, liquid metal compound cools the CPU. A customized self-cleaning 2.0 thermal module clears dust to improve long-term stability, while Arc Flow fans are designed to generate impressive airflow with reduced turbulence, ensuring powerful-yet-quiet cooling.  \\n### Sink Into Sublime Sound  \\nStreaming, recording, and gaming are streamlined with the Zephyrus M16’s multi-faceted audio system. Boasting Dolby Atmos® technology, twin tweeters and dual force-canceling woofers, acoustics are beautifully balanced, with Hi-Res certification that supports media at the highest fidelity. A customizable 3D Mic array captures audio in a variety of scenarios, while Two-Way AI Noise Cancelation clarifies sound from your feed and incoming feeds as well.\\n![](https://dealayo.com/media/wysiwyg/Gaming_laptop/asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-gu603he/asus-rog-zephyrus-m16-gu603he-desc-4-nepal.JPG)  \\n### Lighter.

    "Nothing breaks in-game immersion like stuttering and tearing. GPUs render frames at variable rates, but displays usually refresh at a constant clip, so they frequently get out of sync. With Adaptive-Sync, the refresh rate of the display synchronizes with the GPU’s frame rate to eliminate visual tearing, minimize stuttering, and reduce input lag for gameplay that looks and feels more natural.\n",
